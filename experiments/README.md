# Instructions

Run `experiment_notebook.ipynb` to generate all figures in the paper.
The results of experiments are saved in the `saved_runs` folder. If the files in this folder are deleted, `experiment_notebook.ipynb` will re-run the experiments from scratch and save them in the folder.

`models.py` contains the model implementations, and `dataset_utils` and `utils.py` contain auxiliary utility functions.
